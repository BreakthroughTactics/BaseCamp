## A simple first Repository to store those delicious scripts. :D 
# For the time being, here is a link to my YouTube Channel where I talk about getting the CompTIA Trifecta (A+, Network+ and Security+), post some motivational videos and document my OSCP journey. :)

Projects currently seperated based on complexity and time taken to write the scripts.

Ultra-Mini Projects- Less than one day; The skills needed to write these scripts required less than a day to learn, and the scripts themsleves required less than a day to make.

Ultra-Mini Project Pack 1

These are 3 scripts I wrote while learning about the basics of Bash scripting. 

Pokemon.sh is a script that outputs the lines of the first verse of the Pokemon theme song timed in such a way so that if you're signing it right, the next sentence will appear just as you need it. 

Mock.Account.Creation.sh is what it says. Utilises user input prompt to request a username and a password, hiding the password from view as it is entered.

BooleanForDays.sh is a nickname generator. It takes a user's name, age and gender and then uses a series of if statements (using the AND logical expression) to generate a relevant "nickname". There are 9 possible outcomes (options "man", "woman" and "other" combined with options "below age 15", "above age 55" or "in between").
